~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* P5LP_Development_repo* holds the default Google repo manifest
* It enables Google's "repo" to manage a number of *PSoC 5LP* Component Library and +
 Test Projects repositories. +
* If you are unfamiliar with repo, you can read up on it
https://code.google.com/archive/p/git-repo/[here].

* The *PSoC_5LP Component Library* + 
 repositories catered for are as follows +

 https://github.com/tndP5LP/tndComponent_lib 

 https://github.com/tndP5LP/tndSch_Macro_lib

 https://github.com/tndP5LP/USBAudio_lib

 https://github.com/tndP5LP/Odissey1_lib

 https://github.com/tndP5LP/TDust_UDB_lib  

* Credits go to the following contributers who's work I have borrowed on +
 to create the Library. They have also been a great inspiration in getting +
 my knowledge up to that required to create the Library. Thanks guys.

1.  Michael Bey .... .. CharLCD I2C lib
2.  odissey1 ... ... .... QuadDecoder, DDS24, DDS32, and KIT-059

# I am using Cygwin64 for my Git/Repo working environment

$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo 
....

Edit ~/.bash_profile and uncomment lines 32, 33 and 34 to add ~/bin to
PATH

# Create the PSoC_5LP directory

....
$: mkdir -p ~/projects/tndP5LP

once this has completed you should have PSoC_5LP Component Libraries in
place

# Configure PSoC Creator to add the CDC Component libraries

* Launch PSoC Creator
* Do not Load or Create any project yet so that CDC Library is installed for all Projects
* select "Tools->Options"
* Setup the "Options"  dialog as per the following image

image::images/OptionsDialog.gif[Options Dialog]

* Ensure that "Projects Location" shows ~\projects\tndP5LP\ComponentsTest"
* Now select "Project Management->Default Dependencies"
* Navigate to "~\projects\tndP5LP\Library"
* Use the "New Entry" button to find and "open" each Library's .cyprj file

## When finished the "Project Management->Default Dependencies" dialog should look like the following

# Editing the Components in ~projects/tndP5LP/Library

After using "Repo sync" to fetch all the librarys
"Git status" shows that they are detached which means they are unsuitable for git add, git commit etc
To get around this it is necessary to use the following  Git commands.

....
$: git checkout master   or whatever branch one wishes to use
$: git commit -a
$: git push https://github.com/tndP5LP/CharLCD_I2C_Test.git  (in my case)
....

# TODO this is a "Work in progress"
# My intention is to document all of this more thoroughly using GitHub Wiki
